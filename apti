Solve The Puzzle!

The Rat problem  … 10 marks

This is a very famous but inhuman problem. A few scientists in Area-51 (If you know what 

area-51 is, then please write a few lines about it, you will get some extra marks :-) ) were 

conducting an experiment about inventing an immortal drug.

If any human will take that drug, they will become immortal. 

They developed 100 samples of the immortal drugs. However, one of the scientist 

dropped a bombshell stating that by mistake one of the sample of the drug was not 

prepared correctly and it is fatal.

Whoever will take that drug, he will die after 1 hour! Now, the scientists have a task of finding 

out that fatal drug. To find out they have some rats available. They can test the drug on the rats. 

They need to use minimum number of rats (as PETA are always running after them) to find out 

the defective drug within 1 hour. 

Can you find out a methodology to use minimum number of rats to find out the defective?

Hint: the answer is less than 10.
Ans- 0. There is no way to find out the poisoned drug WITHIN one hour. The question asks us specifically to find out the defective drug WITHIN one hour. However since the rat who takes the poisoned drug will die 
only AFTER one hour and not within one hour. Since we cannot find the poisoned drug within one hour, we should not waste the precious lives of the generous rats!**
